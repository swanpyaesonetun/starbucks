# Coffee Ordering App
This project is a Java-based application designed to simulate a café ordering system. It encompasses various classes that represent different aspects of a café menu, including drinks (like coffee and other beverages), desserts, toppings, and a system to handle customer orders. The application is structured in an object-oriented manner, with a clear division of responsibilities among different classes. This structure allows for easy management and modification of the menu items and orders.
